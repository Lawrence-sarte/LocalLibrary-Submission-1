# LocalLibrary-Submission-1 Local Library Project :
 Project description: Local library
Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Other people are taking care of the logistics and design, but they need you to build the algorithms.
